# RESCOLOR
A resistor color band calculator for the TI-84 Plus CE

# Compatibility
Currently only tested for the TI-84 Plus CE.
Written in TI-Basic and uses color display functionality; if your TI calculator supports this then there is a chance it will work for you as well.

# Installation
Download the RESCOLOR.8xp file.
Load RESCOLOR.8xp onto your calculator using the [TI Connect CE (TM)](https://education.ti.com/en/products/computer-software/ti-connect-ce-sw) application from Texas Instruments.
It is recommended that you load the file into the archive and not the RAM, so that it is persistent.
The file will appear under the "prgm" button.
